{-|
The inventory module predominatelys acts as the user interface for the 'i'nventory and shop screen.
It handles equiping, buy/sell, identification, moving items into packs and other general inventory related logic.

The module subscribes to mouse events for item interactions and is generally high level because it needs
to know about hero equipment, items, containers etc...

{-| Top level of drag/drop transaction.
Algorithm:
- Resolve dragging the item away from the dragSource, return the modelWithDrag and the item being dragged.
- Resolve dropping the item into the dropTarget using the modelWithDrag. Return the modelWithDragDrop.
- If at any time, either resolutions returns a Result.err, return the initial model.

- Shop: Check player can afford item
