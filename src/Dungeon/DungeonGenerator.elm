{-| The dungeon generator module creates a dungeon progressively by allowing the caller
to use the returned Generator type to step through a dungeon creation. The caller can
hook the generator up to a UI and have the user see it being created one step at a
time or it can be called in a fold and generated programmatically.

The strategy used here is like that of a miner with the overarching goal of making
a dungeon that looks like the original Castle of the Winds.

The algorithm is as follows:
1. On initialise, create a room, this will be the entrance to the level with a
   randomly generated up staircase.

2. On each call to 'step', look through the 'active' rooms and corridors. Pick the
   first active room found. Or the first active corridor if there is no active rooms.
   If there are neither active rooms nor corridor, end the step.

3a Given a active room, if there is an unconnected entrance

Active -
   A room or corridor which is still being explored. Once a room or corridor
   has all their entrances connected, and cannot hold any more entrances as
   dictated by the config model, they are no longer active and moved out of
   activePoints.
